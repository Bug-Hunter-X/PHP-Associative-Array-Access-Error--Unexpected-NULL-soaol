In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that aren't strictly numeric.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$myArray = [
    "apple" => 1,
    "banana" => 2,
    "cherry" => 3
];

// Attempting to access using array index instead of key
$value = $myArray[0]; //This will likely return null
// Correct way
$value = $myArray["apple"];

foreach($myArray as $key => $value){
    echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $value . "\n";
}
```

The issue is that attempting to access elements using numerical indices (0, 1, 2, etc.) on an associative array (one with string keys) might lead to unexpected results (often null). PHP doesn't automatically translate string keys into numerical positions.
